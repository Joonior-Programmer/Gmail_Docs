    - NOTE: if SMS passcode was selected a window will pop up asking for a phone number. Enter the RECIPIENT'S phone number and NOT the SENDER'S.

By doing this the email sent will be locked behind a password and will expire after the date you set it to expire. This process will only activate confidential mode for that email, so you will need to do this everytime you want to send a confidential email.
